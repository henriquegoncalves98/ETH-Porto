# ETH-Porto

Integrate an events app with [Sismo](https://docs.sismo.io/sismo-docs/) that leverage userâ€™s data with privacy in mind. This app enables users with specific minimal requirements, like a minimal ethereum balance, to connect to a specific event. At the same time, users can connect their wallet to our app without leaking any private information like the wallet address, full balance, etc.

This way the app can guarantee that only the minimal eligeble users enter the event without jeoperdizing clients private information.
